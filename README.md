abstract

The ”HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM WITH SMART SURVEILLANCE ” is an
innovative application developed for old age homes, addressing the critical challenges of
elder care. Leveraging machine learning and image processing technologies, the system
utilizes existing webcams or additional cameras to capture high-frequency images of el-
derly residents in real-time. The core focus of the system is on fall detection and anomaly
detection, crucial aspects of monitoring elderly individuals’ well-being. Upon detecting a
fall through the implemented algorithms, the system sends immediate alerts and captures
images for further analysis and documentation.
This project also integrates practical solutions for medication management within the
care framework. Caretakers can utilize the system to set pill reminders and alarms, ensuring
timely medication administration. Machine learning algorithms enhance fall detection ac-
curacy by analyzing various features extracted from the captured images, thereby reducing
false alarms and improving overall system reliability. Real-time alerts are transmitted to
designated social network accounts, enhancing monitoring capabilities and ensuring swift
responses to critical incidents.
The Camera Module is instrumental in this system, providing functionalities such as
frame capture, background subtraction, human detection, location estimation, and aspect
ratio detection. These features contribute to detailed activity monitoring, isolate relevant
elements for analysis, and enhance surveillance precision. The notification service serves
as a vital communication bridge, ensuring timely alerts reach designated personnel for
immediate action.
In summary, the Health Monitoring System with Smart Surveillance represents a holis-
tic approach to elder care, combining advanced technologies, real-time monitoring, fall
detection, medication management, and comprehensive image processing. By redefining
care standards within institutional settings, this project aims to improve the overall quality
of life for aging populations while ensuring their safety, well-being, and efficient health
management
